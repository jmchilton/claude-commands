I made some changes to the current work tree and I'd like you to append them
to the previous commit. Update the commit message if necessary but don't be
too aggressive - for instance don't mention small fixes to changes already
in the commit but do mention new features, substantial changes, and correct
any information in the previous commit message outdated by these changes. The commit message should feel whole and atomic.
